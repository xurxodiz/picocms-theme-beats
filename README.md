# Beats

A theme for PicoCMS.

I started with [BitsAndPieces](https://github.com/9hax/Bits-and-Pieces-Theme-for-Pico), but then tweaked quite liberally to fit my needs and likes.

Requires [PicoPagesList](https://github.com/xurxodiz/pico-pages-list) plugin.

Just `git clone` this repo into a `beats` folder inside `themes`, and set config accordingly.
